# LGMVIP-DataScience Internship

# Task Completed

# Task 1:
     This particular ML project is usually referred to as "Hello World" of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, 
     and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data.
     Also, since it is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformation or scaling capabilities.

# Task 4:
     Step 1: Importing Required Libraries.
    
     Step 2: Reading the Image.
    
     Step 3: Convert the Original Image to Grayscale Image.
    
     Step 4: Invert the Grayscale Image.
    
     Step 5: Apply Image Smoothing(Gaussian Blur).
    
     Step 6: Create Pencil Sketch image by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image.
